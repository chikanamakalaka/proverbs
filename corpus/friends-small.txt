There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
Alright Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
Wait, does he eat chalk?
Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and not having sex.
Sounds like a date to me.
Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
Oh, yeah. Had that dream.
Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.
Instead of...?
That's right.
Never had that dream.
No.
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.
And they weren't looking at you before?!
Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very very weird, because- she never calls me!
Hi.
This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.
Are you okay, sweetie?
I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...
Cookie?
Carol moved her stuff out today.
Ohh.
Let me get you some coffee.
Thanks.
Ooh! Oh!
No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?
Fine! Be murky!
I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.
No you don't.
No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!
And you never knew she was a lesbian...
No! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... Did I say that out loud?
I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.
Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren. was what? A wrong number?
Sorry.
Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?
Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just I just wanna be married again!
And I just want a million dollars!
Rachel?!
Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
Can I get you some coffee?
De-caff. Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and you remember my brother Ross?
Hi, sure!
Hi.
So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...
Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.
Tuna or egg salad? Decide!
I'll have whatever Christine is having.
Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!
If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.
Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.
I say push her down the stairs.
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
You can see where he'd have trouble.
Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait! Wait, I said maybe!
Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...
Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, bluebells and sleighbells and something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string. These are a few...
I'm all better now.
I helped!
Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing.
And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.
Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!
What, like there's a rule or something?
Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.
It's, uh, it's Paul.
Oh God, is it 6:30? Buzz him in!
Who's Paul?
Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?
Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
He finally asked you out?
Yes!
Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.
Rach, wait, I can cancel...
Please, no, go, that'd be fine!
Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?
That'd be good...
Really?
No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!
What does that mean? Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?
Hi, come in! Paul, this is... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.
Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?
Okay, umm-umm, I'll just -I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...
A wandering?
Change! Okay, sit down. Two seconds.
Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.
Hey, Paul!
Yeah?
Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.
Shut up, Joey!
So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?
Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
Yes, and we're very excited about it.
Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day.
Okay, sure.
Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?
Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.
Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart. la la la- Thank you. la la la...ohhh!
I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and I cannot feel my legs.
I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
It's a beautiful thing.
What's this?
I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
Which goes where?
I have no idea.
Done with the bookcase!
All finished!
This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.
Hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.
Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.
Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?
You guys.
Oh, God.
You got screwed.
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?
My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her
leg?
That's one way! Me, I went for the watch.
You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
Ooh, steer clear of you.
That's right.
Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me. And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too...
I'm divorced! I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
Shut up!
You must stop!
That only took me an hour.
Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!
You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...
What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
Stay out of my freezer!
Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...
What?... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?
No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation.
Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?
Isn't there?
Yeah... yeah, I think there is. What were you gonna say?
Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform...Sexually.
Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...
It's okay...
I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
Two years.
Wow! I'm glad you smashed her watch!
So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?
...Yeah. Yeah, I do.
We are gathered here today to join Joanne Louise Cunningham and Charles, Chachi-Chachi-Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony.
Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?
Great story! But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea-Angela-Andrea... Oh man,
Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.
Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here.
Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?
Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.
That is amazing.
Congratulations.
Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.
Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... Although actually I'm really not that hungry...
Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.
Morning. Good morning.
Morning.
Morning, Paul.
Hello, Paul.
Hi, Paul, is it?
Thank you! Thank you so much!
Stop!
No, I'm telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness.
We'll talk later.
Yeah. Thank you.
That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?
Shut up, and put my table back.
Okayyy!
Alright, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...
So, like, you guys all have jobs?
Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.
Yeah, I'm an actor.
Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.
Look, it was a job all right?
'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'
I will not take this abuse.
You're right, I'm sorry. Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy...
You should both know, that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler?
So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?
Oh, yeah.
Well, it's like that. With feelings.
Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
Big time!
Want a wedding dress? Hardly used.
I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
Oh, look, wish me luck!
What for?
I'm gonna go get one of those job things.
Hey, Monica!
Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?
You had sex, didn't you?
How do you do that?
Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex! So? Who?
You know Paul?
Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.
You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.
Of course it was a line!
Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
I hate men! I hate men!
Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.
Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
Alright, c'mere, gimme your feet.
I just thought he was nice, y'know?
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
Guess what?
You got a job?
Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!
Oh, how well you know me...
They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!
How'd you pay for them?
Uh, credit card.
And who pays for that?
Um... my... father.
Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary? I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.
C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.
I know that. That's why I was getting married.
Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.
Thank you.
You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.
The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
Alright, you ready?
No. No, no, I'm not ready! How can I be ready? Hey, Rach! You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute? Come on, I can't do this!
You can, I know you can!
I don't think so.
Come on, you made coffee! You can do anything!
C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut...
Y'know what? I think we can just leave it at that. It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
Rachel! That was a library card!
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..
Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!
Well, that's it You gonna crash on the couch?
No. No, I gotta go home sometime.
You be okay?
Yeah.
Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. What?
That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.
Goodnight.
Mmm. Oh, no
sorry
No no no, go
No, you have it, really, I don't want it
Split it?
Okay.
Okay. You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
I knew.
You did! Oh... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
I did.
Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
Yeah, maybe...
Okay... okay, maybe I will...
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
See ya... Wait wait, what's with you?
I just grabbed a spoon.
I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
I can't believe what I'm hearing here...
What? I said you had a
What I said you had...
Would you stop?
Oh, was I doing it again?
Yes!
I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.
Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.
There's an image.
Would anybody like more coffee?
Did you make it, or are you just serving it?
I'm just serving it.
Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.
Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas.
Ahh, miss? More coffee?
Ugh. Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.
Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli
What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.
Yeah, right!...Y'serious?
Oh, yeah!
Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
Absolutely.
Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
Yeah, and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that that... that's not why we bought the ticket.
The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.
...Are we still talking about sex?
No, it's good, it is good, it's just that mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?
Well, she has issues.
Does she.
He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!
Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?
Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?
No. No.
Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!
Okay, okay, yes, it is. How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.
Hi.
So.
You look great. I, uh... I hate that.
Sorry. You look good too.
Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh...
A lesbian?
Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?
Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh
Why- why are you here, Carol?
I'm pregnant.
Pregnant?!
Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.
...Then I've already seen this one!
Are you through with that?
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
Whose little ball of paper is this?!
Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and...now I wish I was dead.
She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that -but, it's fine!
Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.
Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.
That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!
What?
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
Eeaagh!
Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
Yeah, it's beautiful.
Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God...
No, look, don't touch that!
Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...
Easy Rach, we'll find it. Won't we!
Oh! Yeah!
Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?
Doy! Probably right before she lost it!
You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...
...Dinah?
Ohhhh, don't be mad...
You didn't.
Oh, I am sorry...
I gave you one job!
Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!
Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...
I just... can't do it.
Boys? We're going in.
...Hi.
Wow. That is not a happy hi.
Carol's pregnant.
Ooh! I found it!
W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.
Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?
Well now, how do you fit into this whole thing?
Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.
She is so great! I miss her.
What does she mean by 'involved'?
I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.
Anyway, they want me to go down to this sonogram thing with them tomorrow.
So what are you gonna do?
I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.
...Well, this is still ruined, right?
Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. Mmm! What's that curry taste?
Curry.
mmm!
I think they're great! I, I really do.
Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?
They all had a thing for him.
Aw, Mom...
I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?
Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant
No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.
Well, they don't have to know that...
Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?
Yeah.
Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's... easy.
I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.
What that Rachel did to her life... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.
I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing! It's an expression.
No it's not.
Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.
...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.
So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
Okay! Okay. Look, I, uh I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.
And you knew about this?!
Your folks are really that bad, huh?
Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.
Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could -I'd want yours.
Must pee.
Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.
You're twins?
Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.
What does she do?
She's a waitress.
Alright, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.
Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.
Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.
The lights, please..
...How long was I in there?
I'm just cleaning up.
D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?
Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks!
Anyway.. um.. So, you uh you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
Oh.. a little..
Mm-hmm..
A lot.
Mm.
So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been dumped?
Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...
Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?
Got me.
Remember when we were in high school together?
Yeah.
I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet someone, fall in love- and that'd be it? ..Ross?
Yes, yes!
Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here..
Me either...
Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.
Hi.
Ross, you remember Susan.
How could I forget?
Ross.
Hello, Susan. Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?
Dr. Oberman.
..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he
She.
she, of course, she- uh familiar with our.. special situation?
Yes, and she's very supportive.
Okay, that's great. No, I'm Oh.
Thanks.
Quack, quack..
Ross? That opens my cervix.
Barry?
C'mon in.
Are you sure?
Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours.
Huh?!
So, how ya doin?
I'm uh I'm okay... You look great!
Yeah, well..
Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging.
Be right there. Be back in a sec.
I dumped him.
Okay.
So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?
Give me a 'for instance'.
Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?
Marlon
Marlon?!
if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl.
...As in Mouse?
As in my grandmother.
Still, you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?
Julia..
We agreed on Minnie.
'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?
Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?
Oh, not much. I got a job.
Oh, that's great.
Why are why are you so tanned?
Oh, I, uh I went to Aruba.
Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?
No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt.
Me?!
No! I went with Mindy.
Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!
Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.
Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs!
Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.
And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.
Okay..
See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist.
Wow.
You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.
What?
Me.
Anyway, um, I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.
Well, thank you for giving it back.
Hello?!
Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?
Helen Geller? I don't think so.
Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.
Thank you!
No, I mean it's not Geller.
What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?
No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.
Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?
It's my baby too.
Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.
Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!
Alright, you two, stop it!
No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.
Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.
Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.
Oh, no, no no no, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!
My way?! you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can'tdo
Knock knock! How are we today? Any nausea?
Yeah. Yeah. A little.
Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. Uh, lie back..
You- uh y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.
Oh my God.
Look at that.
I know.
Well? Isn't that amazing?
What are we supposed to be seeing here?
I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.
Then don't do that, alright?
Okay!
Monica. Whaddya think?
Mm-hmm.
Wh- are you welling up?
No.
You are, you're welling up.
Am not!
You're gonna be an aunt.
Oh shut up!
Hi, Mindy. Hi, it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now.
Hi guys!
Hey, Pheebs! Hi!
Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?
Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'
Ohh. Ouch.
What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
Since when?
Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.
Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.
And everybody knows this?
Yeah. Cushions the blow.
Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
Uh, Ross.
What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- ...Oh my God, Chi Chi!
So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?
Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.
Hey, that was really good!
Thanks! Let's keep going.
Okay. So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?
I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke.
Smoke away.
I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
What?
Relax your hand!
Not so much!
Whoah!
Hey!
Hey!
Alright, now try taking a puff.
Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.
It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.
Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.
Y'miss it?
Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh.. my.. God.
No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.
That's ridiculous!
Can I use.. either thumb?
Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!
Yeah. Yeah, excellent.
Good for me!
Y'okay, Phoebe?
Yeah- no- I'm just it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank.
What did they do to you?
It's nothing, it's just Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT
Easy.
and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.
Oh, Satan's minions at work again...
Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.
What are you talking about? Keep it!
It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.
Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!
Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...
We're with you. We got it.
Okay. I'd- just I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.
Chandler, what are you doing?
Hey. Whaddya doing?
Oh! Oh, God!
What is this?!
I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.
Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!
And this is my reward!
Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
Okay, so this time I won't quit!
Ohhh! Put it out!
Alright! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.
Oh, no! I can't drink this now!
Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.
This Alan again? How's it goin'?
'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.
So when do we get to meet the guy?
Let's see, today's Monday... Never.
Oh, come on! Come on!
No. Not after what happened with Steve.
What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.
Well, then can we meet him?
Nope. Schhorry.
I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.
I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..
Let it go, Ross.
Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
Do you all promise?
Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!
Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
Hey, Pheebs.
'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!
What bank is this?
Hey. It's him. Who is it?
It's Alan.
Chandler! He's here!
Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.
Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.
Hi.
Hi, Alan.
I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!
Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?
C'mon!
...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.
Loved him! Yeah! He's great!
Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
Yeah!
And did you notice...?
Yeah.
Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.
Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!
...What shoe?
From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'
...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
What future boyfriends? no no, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it.
Really!
Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?
You know what I like most about him, though?
What?
The way he makes me feel about myself.
Yeah...
Hi.. how was the game?
Well..
WE WON! Thank you! Yes!
Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
Alan.
He was unbelievable. He was like that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
I mean, it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
What?
..I dunno, a little too Alan?
Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that we adore.
I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
Hey, Lizzie.
Hey, Weird Girl.
I brought you alphabet soup.
Did you pick out the vowels?
Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, sometimes y. Uh, I also have something else for you.
Saltines?
No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?
What? Oh my God, there's really money in here.
I know.
Weird Girl, what are you doing?
No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.
No, no, I ha-I have to give you something.
Oh, that's fine, no.
Would you like my tin-foil hat?
No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.
Please, let me do something.
Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Keep the change. Sure you don't wanna pretzel?
No, I'm fine.
See ya.
Huh!
A thumb?!
Eww!
I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!
Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
Does, um, anyone wanna see?
Nooo!
Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
It's worse than the thumb!
Hey, this is so unfair!
Oh, why is it unfair?
So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
Well, I could live without it.
Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
Oh, you do, do you?
You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
Indeed there isn't... I should really get back to work.
Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
Ohh-ho-hOoh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
No.
Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.
wait wait.. we talking about the coyotes here? Alright, a cow got through!
Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.
Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!
I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.
No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.
Do you have any respect for your body?
Don't you realise what you're doing to yourself?
Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.
Really? He does? Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!
God, he's good.
If only he were a woman.
Yeah.
Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.
Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.
Hey. Where's Joey?
Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?
I think he's across the hall.
Thanks.
There y'go.
Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.
Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?
Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?
Hey, I might!
Sorry...Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.
You're kidding. Oh my God.
And on my way over here, I stepped in gum...What is up with the universe?!
What's going on?
Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..
Uh, Joey..
Oh, God!
Okay..
Oh! That was Lambchop!
Please, guys, we have to talk.
Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not.
Alright, we have to talk.
There it is!
Okay. it's it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.
Is there somebody else?
No, no no.. it's just.. things change. People change.
We didn't change..
So that's it? It's over? Just like that?
You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just I
Look, I could go on pretending
Okay!
but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan It wouldn't be fair to you!
Who who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were.
I'm sorry..
Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!
I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up I wanted him to meet my family
I'll meet someone else. There'll be other Alans.
Oh, yeah! Right!
Are you guys gonna be okay?
Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time.
I understand.
Wow.
I'm, I'm really sorry.
Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.
Relieved?
Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
Yeah. He could row like a viking.
Hi.
Mmm.
So how'd it go?
Oh, y'know..
Did he mention us?
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.
...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
No no no!
I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!
If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
Yeah, alright.
Alright. Phoebe?
Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!
Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?
Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.
See, there's always one guy. If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes.
Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.
Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
Probably kill myself!
..Excuse me?
Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!
Joey, uh OMnipotent.
You are? Ross, I'm sorry..
How does she do that?
I cannot sleep in a public place.
Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
Oh! what what! ...Hi.
It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.
What's going on with you?
I got no sleep last night!
Why?
My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!
Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
Thanks.
...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.
You got waaay too much free time.
Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you.
Happy birthday, pal!
We love you, man.
Funny, my birthday was seven months ago.
So?
So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?
Well, aren't we Mr. The glass is half empty.
Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?
Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
Ohhh.
What's wrong with the twentieth?
Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship. Sex...You know what, I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.
The hell with hockey, let's all do that!
C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, Huh? Huh? Huh?
What are you doing?
I have no idea.
C'mon, Ross!
Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?
You got it.
Look-look look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me!
I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.
Wow, you worked in a mine?
I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?
God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that.
Oh, this is not that bad.
Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job.
You can totally, totally live on this.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, by the way, great service tonight.
Oh! Yeah!
Hockey! Hockey! Hockey.
Rachel?
Oh my God!
I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom.
What are you guys doing here?
Well, we were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work here, aaand it's true!
Look at you in the apron. You look like you're in a play.
Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it!
I know. I know! I'm a duplex.
So what's going on with you?
Well, guess who my dad's making partner in his firm?
And while we're on the subject of news..
Look, look, I have elbows!
...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!
Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!
We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh she never took'em off, 'cause we we- Sorry. Sorry.
What?
Peach pit.
Yes, Bunny?
Peach pit. That night we, uh we had
Peaches?
Actually, nectarines, but basically...
Could've been a peach.
Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I... I walked her to the bus stop... I'm fine.
Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.
So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!
Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!
Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.
Okay.
When are you coming home?
What? Guys, I'm not.
C'mon, this is us.
I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job
Waitressing?
Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.
Well. Your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
What's that?
Weeell, it's rum, and
Okay.
We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister...
Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!
Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.
Oh, God, ask them what they want.
Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
But I haven't used my card in weeks!
That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.
They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?
Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?
Alright, c'mon! Let's play Twister!
Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.
What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost...
C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.
You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?
You are just like Jack.
...Jack from downstairs?
No, Jack and the Beanstalk.
Ah, the other Jack.
Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village..
Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I know, I know I didn't love him
Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.
But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like...
Floopy?
Yeah.
So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.
Oh, like that's a word.
Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together?
...Pheebs?
Oh, well... 'cause... you just... I don't like this question.
Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?
Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!
See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
Pass it! Pass it!
He's open!
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!
'Scuse me.
It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I'm not completely satisfied.
Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.
Hold on. Fill these out, sit over there.
Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented.
Well, you'll have to wait your turn.
Well, how long do you think it'll be?
Any minute now.
Hey, this Heyy...
I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.
No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
Pizza guy!
Thank God. Food.
Phoebe?
What?
Do you have a plan?
I don't even have a 'pl'.
Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion?
No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos?' Man, my dad's gonna kill me!
Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
Yeah. This one goes across the street, I must have given him yours. Oh, bonehead, bonehead!
Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
Yeah, that sounds about right.
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
and a power tie?
No, pretty much just a towel.
Oh God.
So you guys want me to take this back?
Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!
Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?
Big Bird's friend.
I see pizza!
Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see!
Hello? Who are we spying on?
White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?
Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!
Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman.
Please tell me it's his mother.
Definitely not his mother.
Oh, no...
Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- Hey, that's not for you, bitch!
Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. Ba-!
Light still out?
Yeah.
Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
Oh please, they're having sex.
Shut up!
So, whaddya think George is like?
I think he's shy.
Yeah?
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then when youdo he's a preppy animal.
I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.
Look, it's just a little more complicated...
Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...
Then what?
My first time with Carol was...
What?
It was my first time.
With Carol? Oh.
So in your whole life, you've only been with one oh.
Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!
Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?
Uh-huh.
Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaah!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.
What?! You slept with Jason?
You'd already broken up.
How long?
A couple hours.
Oh, that's nice!
Okay, okay, okay, I got one! Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me.
Excuse me?!
Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl.
Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!
I was laughing! You made me laugh!
There he is! There he is!
Where?
Right where we've been looking all night!
He is so cute!
Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!
Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop the wowww.
Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...
Really?
No, you kidding? The guy's a freak..
Hey, buddy.
Hi.
Oh, that's attractive.
Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.
Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?
Oh, ah- the kid has it.
The kid...? Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.
I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers.
You gotta do it, man.
Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever can't do it. Listen, uh gimme back my puck.
No.
'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!
No! No!
Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!
GIVE ME MY PUCK!
...Now that was fun.
Okay, Monica: Right foot red.
Could've played Monopoly, but nooo.
Thanks.
Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good.
Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people.
Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
Alright. Yes, this is Rachel.
Nooo! Hello? Oh, yeah, no, I know, I haven't been using it much. Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.
Green. To the green.
I've got magic beans. Never-never mind.
To the left, to the left- aww!
Ohhh... I'm fine.
Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. Alright, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
We can? Alright, I'm tryin' that.
Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.
Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.
Multiple orgasms!
So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!
No plans, huh?
Not a one.
Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
Oh, right, right, shut up.
Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.
You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.
Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.
No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.
Tony?
Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?
Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.
Does anybody want anything else?
Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.
What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
That guy, he burns me up.
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.
Did he give you that whole You're-not-up-to-this thing again?
Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of You'll never make it on your own.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Hi, Joey.
My god, Angela.
Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.
Are you gonna go over there?
No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. Hey, Angela.
Joey.
You look good.
That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.
You don't say.
So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?
Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.
Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?
Who?
Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?
Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
Sure.
Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.
Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob...
Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.
Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?
What?
We're just friends.
Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?
What four of us?
You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.
Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...
Oh, god help us.
What?
Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
Ok, bye. Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
Nuh-uh.
Yuh-huh.
So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwear you want it to be dirty?
No.
Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.
There you go.
Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
Yep.
Which?
Which what?
You've never met Bob, have you?
No, but he's...
Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...
Hey, Joey.
...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
Where are they? Where are they?
This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
Eww, I don't wanna do that.
Here we go.
Ok, have a good break-up.
Hey, Janice.
Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.
Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?
We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you...
What?
What?
What... did you get me there?
I got you...these.
Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.
That's great.
Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
No, no, I'm still working on mine.
That's it?
Yeah, it was really hard.
Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
Ok, you weren't there.
Comin' through. Move, move.
Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.
Yeah, well, now you're kinda not.
But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds.
What?
No suds, no save. Ok?
What's goin' on?
Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.
Was your basket on top?
Yeah, but, there were no suds.
So?
Well, you know, no suds, no save.
No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. That's my friend's machine.
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.
Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.
Alright, show's over. Nothing to see here. Ok, let's do laundry.
That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.
What's that?
Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.
Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?
Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?
Rach, have you never done this before?
Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.
Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?
Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.
He is so cute. So, where did you guys grow up?
Brooklyn Heights.
Cleveland.
How, how did that happen?
Oh my god.
What?
I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
So, you and Angela, huh?
Yep. Pretty much.
You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.
Huh, I never really noticed.
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
Monica, Monica is great.
Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
Yeah, isn't he?
It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.
You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
Huh. That's nice.
Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
Alright. Well, there you go. Stop it, stop it, stop it.
Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh.
What uh-oh?
Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.
Ross, what's the matter?
Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
Come on, show me.
Alright, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.
Oh, everything's pink.
Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!
Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
Oh my god.
What?
Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
Come on, they're close.
Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's not really true, is it?
Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
Oh my god, what were you thinking?
Alright, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
Oh!
Ow!
I'm outta here.
Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
Really?
Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.
Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.
Ow!
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
Oh my god. How many of those have you had?
Oh, I don't know, a million?
Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.
I'm fine.
Alright.
I'm not fine. Here she comes.
Wait here. Breathe.
How do you do that?
It's like a gift.
We should always always break up together.
Oh, I'd like that.
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now come on, get outta my way.
I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.
Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!
Let go!
Alright, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
Yes! Did you see that?
You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
I could not have done this without you.
Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? I'm fine, I'm fine.
Are you sure?
No.
Oh, are you sure you're ok?
Yeah.
Does it still hurt?
Yeah.
What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
Hi.
Hey, how'd it go?
Excellent.
We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Where's Chandler?
Oh, he needed some time to grieve.
I'm free! I'm free!
That oughta do it.
Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!
You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
The exclamation point in the title scares me. Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!
Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.
Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. All you want is a dingle, What you envy's a schwang, A thing through which you can tinkle, Or play with, or simply let hang...
God. I feel violated.
Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
Ross, ten o'clock.
Is it? Feels like two.
No, ten o'clock.
What?
There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
Oh. Hel-lo!
She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!
Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.
He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
Thank you, buddy.
Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
You could do that!
Y'think?
Yeah!
Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...
C'mon! C'mon!
Here goes.
...Yes?
Hi... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh...hi.
Yes, you said that.
Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight.
Chandler?
Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
Whadja think?
...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.
Saw your head. Saw your head.
She said yes! She said yes! Awful play, man. Whoah. Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand lrr'. 'Chand lrr'. I think I like it better that way. Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you.
What is it?
The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!
Based on this play? ...Based on this play!
Hey, kids.
Hey.
No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.
Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.
Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand lrr'?
It was unbelievable. I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.
Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon.
Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
'We' would be me and Rick.
Who's Rick?
Who's Rick?
My husband.
Ooh.
Oh, so you're divorced?
No.
Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?
No, I'm still married.
So tell me, howdo how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan.
Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?
mmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.
What?!
So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
I suppose mainly sexual.
...Hm.
Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!
Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?
No, of course not! ...Yeah, yeah, it is.
What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
I couldn't do it.
Good for you, Joey.
When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.
Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking
Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
Yeah! C'mon!
Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey
Tah-daaah!
Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.
Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
Well, whaddya think?
Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!
...Oh! I see you moved the green ottoman.
Uh-oh...
How did that happen?
I dunno.. I thought it looked better there. And I and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.
Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.
You guys, I am not that bad!
Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
That is so unfair!
Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!
Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.
Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.
Why not?
Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
I could do that.
Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
STOP IT! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
Monica? You're Mom.
Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! That was my agent. My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!
Oh my God! Whoah!
Well, what's the part?
Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!
Seriously, what's the part?
Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!
C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?
...I'm his
..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?
...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then I'm his butt.
Oh my God.
C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
Alright, alright, alright...
Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
For what?
Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
Thank you!
Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
C'mon, we're roommates! My eyes! My eyes!
I warned you...
Who is being loud?
Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..
Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?
Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the the old Monica would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.
...Dammit, hire the girl! Okay, everybody ready?
Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
Lose the robe.
Me?
That would work.
Right. Okay. Losing the robe. And the robe is lost.
Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll it.. water's working .. and... action.
And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?
Well, I'm I'm showering.
No, that was clenching.
Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.
I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action...and cut. What was that?
I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
God, I love these fingers...
Thank you.
No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.
Oh my God, I'm late.
Oh no no no no, don't go..
Okay.
Don't go.
Okay. Oh no, I have to.
Too bad, she's leaving.
I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.
Well, I thought I thought you talked to Rick.
It's not Rick.
What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!
No, it's it's Andrew.
I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?
He's... new.
Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
No, that's not exactly what I was..
Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.
So what do you want?
You.
You have me!
no no, just you.
Whaddyou mean?
Lose the other guys.
...Like, ...all of them?
C'mon, we're great together, why not?
Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.
...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'
So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?
I don't know, I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...
Which one?
...The second guy.
Well, call me if you change your mind.
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?
Hey!
Hey, wait wait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
Nope.
No? What happened, big guy?
Big guy?
It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
I got fired.
Oh!
Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.
My mom will.
Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!
Maybe this wasn't your shot.
Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
Hard to tell, I was naked.
No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.
Yeah? That's so nice!
I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
Night.
Uh, Mon, you gonna leave your shoes out here?
Uh-huh!
Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.
She is a kook.
If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help!
Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Hi. Um, I want to start with a song That's about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. OK, thank you very much.
Oh, great. This is just...
Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
Wow, you guys, this is big.
Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK.
Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. What's my number?
Well, I never call me.
Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
Hi Mom, it's Jill.
She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.
Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.
Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.
Hi everyone.
And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.
Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
That had to hurt!
Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!
There you go!
You're definitely scaring here.
Would you like to call somebody?
Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks.
Hello?
Hey, it's me.
It's Chandler! Are you OK?
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.
What?
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
I have no idea what you just said.
Put Joey on the phone.
What's up man?
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Chandler, listen.
Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
Alright, somebody.
OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
Whoooaa!
That's my sister.
OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.
Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
Pheebs, what about you?
Oh... Milwaukee.
Um... Ross?
Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'
No way!
The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
Oh, Rachel.
Oh come on, I already went.
You did not go!
Come on.
Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... oh, the foot of the bed.
Step back.
We have a winner!
I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.
Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
Come on.
No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.
And you didn't marry him because...?
I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...
Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
Yeah right.
It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.
OK.
But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.
You don't.
Uh-uh. See, I see... big passion in your future.
Really?
mmm.
You do?
I do.
Oh Ross, you're so great.
It's never gonna happen.
What?
You and Rachel.
What? Why not?
Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone.
No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.
Ross, you're mayor of the zone.
I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...
Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. What? What, now?
Yeeeaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...'
Shhhh!
What are you shushing?
We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen. Don't you hear that?
Ahhhh!
See?
Huh.
Would you like some gum?
Um, is it sugarless?
Sorry, it's not.
Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.
New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy... la la la, la la, la la...
OK, here goes.
Are you going to do it?
I'm going to do it.
Do you want any help?
You come out there, you're a dead man.
Good luck, man.
Thanks. OK.
OK.
Hey, where are you going?
Outside.
You can't go out there.
Why not?
Because of... the reason.
And that would be?
I, um, can't tell you.
Joey, what's going on?
OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
About what?
He's planning your birthday party.
Oh my God! I love him!
You'd better act surprised.
About what?
My surprise party!
What surprise party?
Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
Well, he didn't tell me.
Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. Looks like I was second to last.
Hmmm... this is so nice.
OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
OK.
OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um...
Ohhh!
Yes, yes, that's right...
Oh, look at the little cat!
What? Ow!
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
Sorry, that was wax.
Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
Yeah?
You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.
Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?
Oh. Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
Er, yeah, it's mine.
He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat.
Wait a minute. What's his name?
Ehhhh... B-Buttons.
Bob Buttons?
Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.
Ooh! You are a very bad man!
You owe me a cat.
Here, kitty kitty. Here kitty kitty. Where did you go, little kitty kitty kitty? Here kitty kitty kitty kitty...
Wow.
Lucky sixes...
Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
Hi!
And Joey...
Hi!
And Ross.
Hi!
He doesn't speak much English.
Monopoly!
Look at that!
So, um... where did Paolo come from?
Oh... Italy, I think.
No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
That, that is funny... and Rachel keeps touching him.
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.
You betcha!
Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.
Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.
Good save! We're back on track, and I'm...chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.
Are you alright?
My God, you're choking! That better?
Yes... thank you. That was... that was...
Perfection?
Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaah...
WhaWhat did he say that was so funny?
I have absolutely no idea.
That's... that's classic.
Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!
If you want, I'll do it.
I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. But I won't.
God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.
Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooddddddd...
Paolo. Hi.
Ross!
Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.
Thing?
Thing, yes. Thing.
Ah, you... have the sex?
No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the... um...
Bed?
No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.
Oh!
Yeah! Se vice?
Si.
So you do know a little English.
Poco... a leetle.
Do you know the word crapweasel?
No.
That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!
Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy.
OK.
Ready?
No, you've got to whip it.
Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48...
Thank you.
Thanks.
Kinda... spooky without any lights.
Bwah-hah-hah!
OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooo-hah-hah...
Oh.. oh... oh.
Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
Well, this has been fun.
Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. See ya.
Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
Hey gorgeous, how's it going?
Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.
Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
Do you want a date Saturday?
Yes please.
Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's
He's a he?
Well yeah! ...Oh God. I just I thought Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now... Okay, goodbye...
...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...
You did?
Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.
Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
I did.
Yeah, I think so, yeah.
Not me.
no no, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.
You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...
Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?
I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...
Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
Yeah! Right!
WHAT IS IT?!
Okay, I d'know, you just you have a quality.
Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio.
So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. I'm talking to Rome.
Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
So, uh, how's she doing?
The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
How are you, Mom?
Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here...What's with your hair?
What?
What's different?
Nothing.
Oh, maybe that's it.
She is unbelievable, our mother is...
Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
Oh God!
The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from restaurants.
Not just restaurants, from our house.
Mrs. Geller?
She looks so small.
I know.
Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.
G'bye, Nana.
Bye, Nana.
Ross!
What is going on?!
Y'know how the nurse said that that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..
What?
She's not- past, she's present, she's back.
What's going on?
She may have died.
She may have died?
We're looking into it.
I, uh, I'll go see.
This almost never happens!
Now she's passed.
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?
Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.
Yeah, you have homosexual hair.
So, um, did she...
Twice.
Twice?
Oh, that sucks!
You guys okay?
I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...
Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
no no, she's gone.
We checked. A lot.
Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.
Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?
Thanks!
Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?
Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie.
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!
Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
I don't see why not.
Here's my retainer!
I was just thinking. When my time comes
Dad!
Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.
You what?
I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun.
Define fun.
C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...
...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.
Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.
That's probably what they'll say.
I'd like that.
Hey, gorgeous.
Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um
No, no no, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.
Oh! Okay! Phew!
So, uh... what do you think it is about me?
I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...
...Quality, right, great.
Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.
Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?
What? He's cute!
Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
Is Brian...?
No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.
Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me...I'm really not.
This one?
No.
I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.
You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.
You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.
Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out.
Wait! We need shoes!
Okay. Um, how about these?
That's really a day shoe.
And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.
No, it really should be burgundy.
Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?
No! no no no, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.
Oh my God..
Is everything all right, dear?
Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.
How we doing, you guys ready?
Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
Some days it's all I can think about.
Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.
Oh, you mean your earrings?
What'd I say?
Hmm.
Are these the shoes?
Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
What, we-uh we don't have shoes here, or...?
Morning. We ready to go?
Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?
It was a really beautiful service.
It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream.
What?
Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
Check it out, Giants-Cowboys.
You're watching a football game at a funeral?
No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
You are a frightening, frightening man.
Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
Oh, I hope they're not ruined.
God, what a great day...What? Weather-wise!
I know, uh, the air, the the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh I dunno, almost life aff
God! Ross!
I'm fine. just... having my worst fear realised...
Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh.
What, what is it?
You missed a belt loop.
Oh! No n
Okay, it's in spasm.
Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident.
Oh, no
sorry Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter.
Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?
I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.
Wow, those pills really worked, huh?
Not the first two, but the second two- wooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister , I love Pheebs...
Ooh! That's so nice...
...Chandler!
Hey.
And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to me.
You were right.
Rachel. Rachel Rachel. I love you the most.
Oh, well you know who I love the most?
No.
You!
Oh.. you don't get it!
Whaddya got there?
Just a, uh... hearing disability.
What's the score?
Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.
Beautiful!
Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?
Your grandmother would have hated this.
Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.
No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'.
That sounds like Nana.
Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?
...I can imagine.
I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.
That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
Tell her what?
How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.
I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along.
Huh.
More wine, dear?
Oh, I think so.
Those earrings look really lovely on you.
Thank you. They're yours.
Actually they were Nana's.
Now I'm depressed! ... Even more than I was.
Hey, who's this little naked guy?
That little naked guy would be me.
Aww, look at the little thing.
Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
Who are those people?
Got me.
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
Looks like a fun gang.
Ooh, look look! I got Monica naked!
no no, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.
Hey, Lowell.
Hey, Chandler.
So how's it going there in Financial Services?
It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?
Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.
I know. That's what I told her.
Really.
Yeah.
So- you can tell?
Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.
So you don't think I have a, a quality?
Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is.
He is?
Yup, and waaay out of your league.
Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian.
Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?
An advance?
It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.
Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? Oh, look at that.
Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?
Huh?
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. Only $98.50 to go.
Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
No, they're not.
Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.
You're wrong.
I am not wrong.
You're wrong.
No, I just talked to them.
I'm calling Mom.
Hey, hey.
Hey.
Hey.
And this from the cry for help department. Are you wearing makeup?
Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.
That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.
What were you modeling for?
You know those posters for the city free clinic?
Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those healthy, healthy, healthy guys?
You know, the asthma guy was really cute.
Do you know which one you're gonna be?
No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so...
Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
Thanks.
Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving.
Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.
Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
You know, they're not actually supposed to have... I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
Yeah.
And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
Yes, every single one of them.
Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?
Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.
So you're free Thursday, then.
Yeah. Oh, can I come?
Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.
I thought it was $98.50.
Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.
Well, I'm off to Carol's.
Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?
Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
Hi, is uh, is Carol here?
No, she's at a faculty meeting.
Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in.
Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
What's it look like?
Kinda like a big face without skin.
Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.
Ok. Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.
Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.
Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?
Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
Do you uh, do you talk about me?
Yeah, yeah, all the time.
Really?
But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.
Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
Rach, here's your mail.
Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
No, here's your mail.
Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
Would you just open it?
Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.
We all chipped in.
We did?
You owe me 20 bucks.
Thank you. Thank you so much!
Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
Alright, I'm nine years old.
Oh, I hate this story.
We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have-and I remember this part vividly-a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
Oh my god.
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.
We did?
Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. Aramis? Aramis?
Yeah, right.
I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
Get out.
I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.
Really? You don't know what that means to me.
Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?
Nothing.
Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?
Yeah. Oh.
What's wrong?
I just remembered, I have to do something.
Oh. What?
Um, leave.
Wait, wait, wait!
So I guess you all saw it.
Saw what?
No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.
Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. What?
I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
Alright, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.
That's closer.
I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.
Oh, you must stop shooping.
Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.
Chandler, will you just come in already?
No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
That's not a question.
But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
Alright, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
Ah!
Ok, Mom never hit.
Ok, all done.
What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
Why would we do that?
Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Ok, goodbye you guys. Thanks for everything. Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
The balloon?
No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
I can't, I gotta go.
Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
Almost never.
Got the keys? or Got the keys!
Ok.
Anytime you're ready.
Ok, ok, here we go. Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...
Just aim for the bump.
Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.
So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.
Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.
Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?
We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
No I don't.
Yes, you do. When we left, you said, got the keys.
No I didn't. I asked, got the ke-eys?
No, no, no, you said, got the keys.
Do either of you have the keys?
The oven is on.
Oh, I gotta get my ticket!
Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
Well then get it, get it!
That tone will not make me go any faster.
Joey!
That one will.
And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.
Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.
Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?
Hi, how's it goin?
Shh! Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
I did.
Does it always, uh?
No, no that was the first.
Keep singing! Keep singing!
Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.
I felt it!
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.
Nope, not that one.
Can you go any faster with that?
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
For an emergency just like this.
Alright, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this right now. But I'm not.
I swear you said you had the keys.
No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.
Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.
Why would I have the keys?
Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
But I didn't.
Well, you should have.
Why?
Because!
Why?
Because!
Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...
Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.
Well, the turkey's burnt. Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
Here we come, walkin' down the this doesn't smell like Mom's.
No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.
Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.
Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
You call that delicious?
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
Ooh.
What?
Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
I've gotta see this. Alright Ugly Naked Guy!
Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!
It's nice that he has someone.
Shall I carve?
By all means.
Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
Does anybody wanna split this with me?
Oh, I will.
Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.
Make a wish?
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
The bigger half.
I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
That's so sweet.
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
And a crappy New Year.
Here, here!
Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.
Ooh!
W-wait. What is that?
'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
No, no, I don't.
Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?
My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!
Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...
Why don't you just get a roommate?
Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- ...sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.
So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.
Might wanna open with the snowman.
Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy.
So, how'd it go?
Ahhhh, I didn't get the job.
How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political.
So what are you gonna be?
Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?
Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?
Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops! Man, I'm talking loud!
Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.
Yeah, you wish!
It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.
Yeah, okay. Alright.
Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.
Wooo! Yeah!
Phoebe, you're on.
Oh, oh, good.
Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!
Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year. I made a man with eyes of coal. And a smile so bewitchin', How was I supposed to know that my mom was dead in the kitchen? La la la la la la la la la la la la la...
My mother's ashes, Even her eyelashes. Are resting in a little yellow jar, and sometimes when it's breezy...
...I feel a little sneezy And now I Excuse me, excuse me! Yeah, noisy boys! Is it something that you would like to share with the entire group?
No. No, that's- that's okay.
Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!
That guy's going home with a note!
Noth I was I was just saying to my
Could you speak up please?
Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my life. And then he said that you said you thought
Daryl Hannah.
Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a
Hard quality.
hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that's when you started yelling.
Okay, we're gonna take a short break.
Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!
Come here, Marcel. Sit here.
Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?
Just a smidge.
David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.
I think it's romantic.
Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
Yeah!
Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...
Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.
No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?
Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.
What?!
C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!
I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.
Yeah, but Janice? that that was like the worst breakup in history!
I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!
Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.
Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
Nice shoes, huh?
Aah, y'killing me!
Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
Do you always have to bring him here?
I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.
Okay, alright, I have a question, then.
Yuh.
Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?
Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.
Sure.
Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.
Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.
Rrrreally.
Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.
...Now? Now?
Oh yeah, right now.
Okay, okay, okay. Y'know what, this was just really expensive. And I'll take- this was a gift.
Okay, now you're just kinda tidying.
Okay, what the hell, what the hell. You want me to actually throw you or you wanna just hop?
I can hop.
So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
Yeah.
You know more than one Fun Bobby?
I happen to know a Fun Bob.
Okay, here we go...
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
There. Now there is.
Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.
Uh, four.
Four.
Five.
Five.
Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?
Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?
Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.
Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.
What's the matter?
Oh, it's it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...
That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.
Really.
Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
What, uh... what juggling thing?
With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
No.
Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...
Phoebe. Hi.
Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?
No. Have you seen David?
No, no, he hasn't been around.
Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.
Minsk?
Minsk. It's in Russia.
I know where Minsk is.
We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.
So when, when do you leave?
January first.
Hello?
Hey!
Hi.
Hi! what're you doing here?
Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so congratulations! This is so exciting!
It'd be even more exciting if we were going.
Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?
Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on no no no. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!'
Thank you, Max. Thank you.
So-so you're really not going?
I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just you decide.
Oh don't do that.
Please.
Oh no no.
No, but I'm asking
Oh, but I can't do that
No, but I can't
It's your thing, and
make the decision
Okay, um, stay.
Stay.
Stay.
Getting so good at that!
It was Max's stuff.
I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!
You remember Janice.
Vividly.
Hi.
Hi, I'm Sandy.
Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! ...You brought your kids.
Yeah. That's okay, right?
Par-tay!
That thing is not coming in here.
'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?
I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
Alright. Just keep him away from me.
Thank you. C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.
Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where's Paolo?
Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
And then... your face is bloated?
No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? Are people eating my dip?
Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.
Wow, that's, uh, dirty.
Yeah.
Hey, kids...
Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.
There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!
But you found me!
Here, Ross, take our picture. Smile! You're on Janice Camera!
Kill me. Kill me now.
Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!
Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.
Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.
Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we
Oh, no. Oh, no.
I'm sorry you misunderstood...
Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me.
Oh, will you give me the thing.
Hi, Max!
Yoko. I've decided to go to Minsk without you.
Wow.
It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year.
Are you alright?
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
You're going to Minsk.
No, I'm... not going to Minsk.
Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.
Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can't break up with you.
Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say 'no! No! I can't understand that!'.
Uh, ow.
Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.
I'll never forget you.
And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.
Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square...
There y'go, kids.
And then the peacock bit me. Please kiss me at midnight.
You seen Sandy?
Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.
Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.
What?
The bll is drrbing!
In twenty seconds it'll be midnight...
And the moment of joy is upon us.
Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.
Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!
Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.
I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
I can't kiss anyone.
So I'm kissing everyone?
no no no, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.
Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!
Alrightalrightalright. There.
I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.
...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
Why?
Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.
Oh my God. Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
Where? Ooh, come to Momma.
He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
Nice hat.
Thanks.
We should do something. Whistle.
We are not going to whistle.
Come on, do it.
No!
Do it!
No!
Do it do it do it!
Woo-woo!
I can't believe you did that!
Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? that that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?
I just wish there was something we could do. Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!
Phoebe, what are you doing?
Maybe nobody's tried this.
I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.
Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!
Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
I wish all guys could be like him.
I know.
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
He doesn't have anyone.
Yeah, we feel kinda responsible.
I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!
Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.
Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.
No way, forget it.
C'mon, she's your mom!
Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?
Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!
Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
You can say that because she's not your mom.
Oh, please...
Bona sera.
Oh, hi sweetie.
When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
Last night.
Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew.
Hey hey hey! She's on!
Ah! Nora Bing!
...Now what is this about you being arrested in London? What is that all about?
Your mom was arrested?
Shhh, busy beaming with pride.
...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man...
Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
Shhh.
...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.
THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!
Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?
Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love...
aww!
This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
Y'know, don't take this wrong, I just don't see you a-as a mom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad...
Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.
...And then he burst into flames.
Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and oh, teams played sports.
What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
Nah... not-not special enough.
Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
Waaay too special.
I am famished. What do I want...
Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?
Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
Ooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug. Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.
I know I am.
Who's doing shots?
Yeah.
I'm in.
There y'go. Ross?
Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.
Hi! sorry sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time.
...But a man can change.
Anyone want me to appraise anything?
Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.
Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.
Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
Yeah, any messages for room 226?
You okay there, slugger?
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
What is with you tonight?
Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
Okay, thank you. It's the Italian Hand Licker, isn't it.
No. It's the one he's licking.
She's supposed to be with you.
You're good.
Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why?
The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off.
When?
He's not a hero...You know who our hero is.
The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
No, it's you!
Please.
No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy...
Right.
You are gonna be fine, believe me.
Uh-oh...
Uhhhh... I'll just pee in the street.
Hey, is Chandler here?
Yeah.
Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?
Right. No big deal.
Okay.
In Bizarro World! You broke the code!
What code?
You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
What are you guys doing out here?
Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.
No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.
Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
Okay, you guys spend waaay too much time together.
Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.
Ross, how could you let this happen?
I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's...
You don't think my mom's sexy?
Well... not in the same way...
I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...
Hey.
Hey.
What're you guys doing out here?
Well, not playing raquetball!
He forgot to leave his grip size!
He didn't get the goggles!
Well,sounds like you two have issues.
Goodbye, baby.
Ciao, bela.
Do they wait for me to do this?
So are you gonna tell him?
Why would I tell him?
How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
Oh...
What are you guys doing here?
Uhhhh... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
...What did I ask?
Hi.
Hi.
What are you doing here?
Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?
I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
No. No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
How would I know? I wasn't here.
Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?!
Oh my God.
You're my friend. I had to tell you.
I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh... I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.
What?
I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora um, Mrs. Mom your Bing was just being nice, y'know, and But nothing happened, nothing Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in
You knew about this?
Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.
Thanks, man, big help.
I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
I wasn't- I mean, I
Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.
I know
I can't believe you did this.
Chandler
Me neither, y'know what
I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
What are you mad at me for?!
Chandler
You gotta let me slam the door!
Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! See what happens when you break the code?
Joey
Ah! Huh?
Hey.
Hey.
'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.
Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?
Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.
Hey Rach.
Hey.
Hello.
Hello.
Going to the hospital tonight?
No, you?
No, you?
You just asked me.
Okay, maybe it was a trick question. Um, Rachel can we do this now?
Okay. I am so hot!
Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.
I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. 'Kay. You don't have to be awake to be my man, As long as you have brainwaves I'll be there to hold your hand. Though we just met the other day, There's something I have got to say...
Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!
What was that?
Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...
Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser?
Mother-Kisser... I'll shut up.
Chandler, can I just say something? I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!
We're rehearsing a Greek play.
That's very funny. We done now?
No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?
That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
Okay, 'you' can't, or you can't? Okay, that's my finger. That's, that's my knee. Still doing the play. Aaah!
Alright, whadyou do with him?
Oh! You're awake!
Look at you! How, how do you feel?
Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.
You look good!
I feel good! ...Who are you?
Oh, sorry.
I'm Phoebe Buffay.
I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
Well, we both have.
So, the Etch a Sketch is from you guys?
Well, actually it's just from me.
I got you the foot massager.
You know who shaved you? That was me.
I read to you.
I sang. Hah!
Well,... thanks.
Oh, my pleasure.
You're welcome.
So. I guess I'll see you around.
What, that's it?
See you around?
Well, what do you want me to say?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, That was nice? Admit something to me? I'll call you?
Alright, I'll call you.
I don't think you mean that.
This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and See you around! Let's go, Phoebe.
Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.
Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
Alright, well, be good, I love you.
You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
Really stupid.
Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?
Yeah. No. No...
Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
You're kidding.
No, no. He said When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?
Wow!
Then she came back with The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?
'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?
That makes more sense.
So, what's going on now?
I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Whaddya see?
Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
You okay, kiddo?
Yeah, okay.
Alright.
Nice save.
Mrs. Bing.
Mr. Geller.
Hey.
You mean that?
Yeah, why not. So I told her.
Yeah? How'd it go?
Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
Well, howdya feel?
Pretty good! I told her.
Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? But.. we don't have to go down that road.
Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.
What's a 'niffle'?
You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...
Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!
Nooo!
no no, we're done.
Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.
Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that!
Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta.
And, we're done with the yogurt.
Sorry.
Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? Nice talk, Aunt Syl. You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? This is your baby. Hi Daddy!
Hello!
How come you don't live with Mommy? How come Mommy lives with that other lady? What's a lesbian?
Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos
Ah, poke a nose, mmm
Mma, Mma, Mmaah
So, did I hear Poconos?
Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!
Yeah, that's a big step.
I know...
Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be... flung by now?
I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally...
...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? I could call immigration!
I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...
Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
Need a new table.
You think?
Hey hey, come on in!
Hey, hello! mmwa! I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna.
Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat.
I'm pretty sure that it is...
So, I got the results of the amnio today.
Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh...?
Totally and completely healthy!
Oh, that's great, that is great!
Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?
Uh, that's our friend Tanya.
Of course it's your friend Tanya.
Don't you want to know about the sex?
The sex? Um, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya , yaw...
The sex of the baby, Ross.
Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!
Do you want to know?
No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is! Or isn't...
Oh, hello Ross!
Susan...
So, so, did you hear?
Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!
Oh, that's so... It really is...do we know...?
Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be...
Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here!
Oh, well, is it what we thought it would be?
Mm-hmmm
Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?
It's a...
No, no, no I don't want to know, don't want to know. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go.
Well, thanks for the books.
No problem, ok, mmmwa oh, mmmwa Susan...
Alright, who should we call first, your folks, or Deb and Rona?
Hello?
Uh, never mind, I don't want to know.
Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
That's the rule.
What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
How'd you get to that?
Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
You knew about that?
Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
What do you mean, like, buy it together?
Yeah
You think we're ready for something like that?
Why not?
Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
Why, are you moving out?
I'm not moving out.
You'd tell me if you were moving out right
Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
Aw, I know all about Kip!
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
Aw, don't do that
We've got a couple changes in your schedule. Your 4:00 herbal massage has been pushed back to 4:30 and Miss Somerfield cancelled her 5:30 shiatsu.
Ok, thanks.
Oh, here comes your 3:00. I don't mean to sound unprofessional, but, yum
Buon Giorno, Bella Phoebe!
Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?
Uh, Racquela tell me you massage, eh?
Well, Racquela's right, yeah!
Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started.
Uh, I am, uh, being naked?
Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!
I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows...
And Monica knows...
Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
So what's it gonna be?
Wait oh hey huh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!
I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
Or an uncle...
Hey Phoebe!
Hi Pheebs!
Pheebs!
Fine!
Phoebe, what's the matter?
Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.
Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?
Oh, right, that's me!
Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
Fine.
Phoebe, what is it?
Alright, you know Paolo?
I'm familiar with his work, yes...
Well, he made a move on me.
Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!
More coffee over here, please!
Well, what happened?
Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until.
Ooh!
My God.
Are you sure?
Oh yeah, I'm sure. And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
Was it...?
Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.
Oooo...
Ooo, what?
Uma Thurman.
Oh!
The actress!
Thanks Rach.
So what are you gonna do?
You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys?
Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
Feminist issue. That's where I went!
She is gonna hate me.
Yeah, well...
Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?
That's patio furniture!
So what, like people are gonna come in and think, Uh-oh, I'm outside again? Of course!
What about the birds?
I don't know, birds just don't say, Hello, sit here, eat something.
You pick one.
Alright, how about the ladybugs?
Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
Not like that, I won't! Kip would have liked the birds!
Hey!
Hi Pheebs!
Are you moving out?
No, these aren't all my suitcases. This one's Paolo's.
Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?
Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
Oh! Ok, um, ok, um,
Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...
Ok, um, we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.
Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
Alright, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
Which proves that I never lie.
I guess you don't.
Paolo made a pass at me.
So, what do you think?
I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
I know!
So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
Heads up Ross! Score! You suck!
Are you okay?
I need some milk.
Ok, I've got milk Here you go... Oh! Better?
No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so... Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!
I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!
Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!
I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?
I don't know...right, he's the pig!
Such a pig!
Oh, God, he's such a pig,
Oh he's like a...
He's like a big disgusting...
...like a...
...pig ...pig man!
Yes, good! Ok...
Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?
Oh! I know! It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...
Ok, Ok, Pheebs...
The end.
Oh, God...
Should I not have told you?
No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
We should get over there and see if she's okay. Just one...second! Score! Game! Come on.
Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
No no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
Come on, two on one.
What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
What, now?
Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!
No, that's cold, that's cold, that's...
How's it going?
Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , Ok, that is either, How could you? or, Enormous breasts! Here he comes!
Ooh!
Uh, I am, uh, to say goodbye.
Oh, ok bye-bye.
Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
Grazie.
Paolo, I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say...
Oh, just look at her...
Oh you guys, I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed...
Oh, you're right.
...and I really think it should be me.
Hey.
Hey.
You all right?
Ooh, I've been better...
Come here. Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.
Oh, Ross...
What?
I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy.
Huh.
Oh Ross, you're so great!
Ohhhh
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?
Oh...
You ok?
...medium...hmm...any cookies left?
Yep!
See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want
Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.
No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.
What?
What?
I'm, I'm having a boy?
Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.
Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! Huh, am I having a boy?
Yes, you're having a boy!
I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
What?
What?
What is it?
I'm having a boy! I'm having a boy!
Hey!
Hey!
We already knew that!
I'm having a son. Um...
Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
Shut-out!
Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
Yeah, get out!
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! Alright, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, and I'm gone.
One more game?
Oh yeah!
That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock
I'm sorry!
You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
Rachel, wait, wait.
No, you wait! This is ridiculous!
Can I just say one thing?
What? What?!
That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
Oh!
Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.
That's pretty much it.
Oops!
But you tell it really well, sweetie.
Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you.
Okay. I'll miss you.
Isn't he great?
He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.
I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?
So, you think you'll do it on his couch?
Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.
Okaaay. Any of you guys want anything else?
Oh, yes, could I have one of those.
No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?
Okay.
Did I, uh, did I miss something?
No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?
Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.
Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.
Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.
Okaaay, rock, hard place, me.
You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops.
Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?
Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance.
Huh.
I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam...Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty.
Uhhuh, how did you know that?
It's textbook.
Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?
Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!
Hey, how long are you in the city?
Just for a coupla days. I got a job midtown. I figure I'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry. I don't know this one.
Oh, this is my friend Roger.
Hi.
Hey, hey. Good to meet you, Roger.
You too, sir.
What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?
Dad, dad.
Oh, 'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife? Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny!
Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now
Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? Did you know this isn't Ma?
Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.
Sure. So how long you been...
Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?
Since then?!
No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy...Joe. Y'ever been in love?
...I d'know.
Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
You're one to talk.
Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.
Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. That'd be cool... This blows!
I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
What? What?
Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.
Y'know, I don't see that happening?
C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.
Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'
Hello?
It's Phoebe.
And Rog.
C'mon up.
Oh, good. Rog is here.
What's the matter with Rog?
Yeah.
Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.
What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.
Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level that that she was a lesbian?
I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.
Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?
I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...
Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.
Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.
That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
Isn't he good?
no no no, that that's not what I was saying...
Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!
Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!
You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.
That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going.
Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?
Geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie...
Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.
You're welcome.
Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love.
Hate that guy!
Night, you guys.
Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.
Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?
Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.
I'm Joey Tribbiani.
Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures! I'm, I'm Ronni...Cheese Nip?
Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?
Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
That's a good one!
Hey, Joe.
Dad, Ronni's here.
Huh?
Hi.
Hey! Hello, babe! Wh what're what're you doing here?
Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting.
Thank you. Uh...
So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come. I'd better get going, I don't wanna miss the last train.
I don't want you taking that thing.
Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?
Who-ah-ho.
We'll go to a hotel.
We'll go to a hotel.
No you won't.
No we won't.
If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
You're gonna keep an eye on us?
That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
Wow. He's strict.
Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.
Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.
C'mon, I'll show you to my room...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by No thanks, it's late.
Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.
What kinda change?
Well, either you break it off with Ronni
I can't do that!
Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
Yeah, but this is
I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
Well, you're gonna.
I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
No.
No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say No thanks, I'm married.
You really think so?
Yeah. I really do.
Thanks, Chandler.
Get off!
Hi.
Hi...May I help you?
Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in ours?
Okay...who are you?
Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?
Oh, c'mon in.
Thanks.
Hi, I'm Rachel.
Hi.
Bathroom's up there.
Great.
Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?
Oh, like, uh, five minutes?
Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. Hey, Mr. Trib.
Hey. Morning, dear.
Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
What's the matter with you?!
I thought it was Chandler!
What? What?
You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.
Hey, Pheebs.
Hey.
How's it going?
Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
So what's going on?
Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.
I dunno, there's just something about...
Basically we just feel that he's...
We hate that guy.
Yeah. Hate him.
We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?
...No, we hate him.
We're sorry.
Ma! What're you doing here?
I came to give you this and this.
Oww! Big ring!
Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really.
Hold on, you knew?
Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. I'm sleeping over at my accountant's, I mean, what is that? Please!
So then how could you I mean, how could you?!
Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.
Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?
Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.
I'm...happy...for you?
Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was.
Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.
I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?
Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
That's sweet. Could I take her?
With this ring? No contest.
What's wrong, sweetie?
Nothing, nothing.
aaah, what's wrong, c'mon.
It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.
Oh. They don't.
But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...
What?
Intense and creepy.
Oh.
But I don't. Me, Phoebe.
Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.
You're not? See, that's why you're so great!
Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'.
So you talked to your dad, huh.
Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.
Wow.
Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
So Joey, you okay?
Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.
Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty year old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.
Hey.
Hey, Pheebs.
How's it going?
Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.
aww.
Yeah, right.
Aaaww!
What happened?
I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!
Hey, Joey. What's going on?
Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.
Joey! What the hell were you doing?!
Sorry. Wrong boobies.
Hello, Joey.
Oh! ...Hello, dear.
I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.
She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
Any contact?
She lent me an egg once.
You're in!
Aw, right.
Hi, Ross.
Hey.
Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbian I don't think we need a third...
Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.
An egg?
Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg.
I think it's winning.
I think it's insane.
She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.
Think it'll work?
No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.
You can not do this.
Do what, do what?
Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!
But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.
Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
Pathetic mess? I know, but come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.
Hi. She said yes.
Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh?
How do I look?
Oh, uh, I... don't... care. Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.
...And what did you bring?
She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
Janice?
Oh... my... God.
Hey, it's Janice.
Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.
No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!
Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
Which one was Pete Carney?
Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. Was it good for you?
Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-I-win-guy. I win! I win! I went out with the guy for two months I didn't get to win once.
How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
There's more beer, right?
Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.
Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.
Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.
Ok, well, what kind of ritual?
Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.
Or?
Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.
Burning's good.
Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.
You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.
Good for you. Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
That's OK.
Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
We can't do that.
What? What can't you do?
Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?
Uh, we might be leaving now.
Tell me it's you and me we.
She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.
Ok, you can not do this to me.
You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.
Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?
I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.
I hope she throws up on you.
So...
Just us.
Oh, what a crappy night!
Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.
Excuse me. How ya doin'?
So, do we have the best friends or what?
Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
I will go for that drink.
You got it. Good woman! Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
Each.
That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. I've always wanted to know...
Happy Valentine's Day!
Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?
No... no! And yet it did. goodbye, Janice.
Kiss me!
Oh, Chandler, sorry.
Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
Hi, Monica.
Ok, well, this was very special.
Rach, come see who's out here!
Oh my god. Janice, hi!
Janice is gonna go away now.
I'll be right back.
Oh, Joey, look who it is.
Whoa.
Oh, good, Joey's home now.
This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.
Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. He just happened to call.
Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know?
I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
That's funny. Who are they?
The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.
You mean they're lovers.
If you wanna put a label on it.
Wow, uh, anything else I should know?
Nope, nope, that's it.
Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. Helloo!
Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.
All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.
Um, that's ok! Ok. Alright. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.
Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
Can we just start throwing things in?
Ok, yeah, ok. Oh, OK.
Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.
Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
Hey he's wearing a sweater.
No.
Eww!
And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...
How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
Hello, funny Valentine.
Hi, Just Janice.
Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gonna!
If you don't do it, I will.
So, um, what do you do for a living?
Well, um, for the past few years I've been working...which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.
Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
I guess.
Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin...does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
What do we got there?
A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred picture Wow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!
You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
It's all right. It's all right. You don't have to explain. This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.
You're our third call tonight.
Really?
Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.
I brought you something.
Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. Chan and Jan Forever.
I had them made special.
Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.
That's fine.
It is?
Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.
Oh no, you see, actually it is.
No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.
Oh, no I don't.
Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?
I did, but...
You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya.
Call me!
It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.
You did so. I swear, I swear How long has she been in the bathroom?
Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.
Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
That could be it.
Oh, god. You know, this is still pretty hot.
Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny
No, it's just...you know the whole getting on with your life thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.
Oh, I love you too. But...
No but, no but.
You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you.
That's easy for you to say, you found one already.
All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.
Not her.
We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?
So, um, will you bring the truck?
I'll even let you ring the bell.
Oh, my god.
See, there you go, the cleansing works!
They're nice guys.
Oh, they're firemen guys.
You guys tell them you were married?
No way!
Are you kidding? My girlfriend doesn't know, I'm not gonna tell them!
Coffee.
Thank you.
Cappuccino.
Grazie.
And a nice hot cider for Monica.
Aww, thank you. Uh Rach?
Yeah?
Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
Oh! That's why. I'm sorry!
Chandler.
Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.
Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. Nothing.
Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...
Hey!
Hey!
Never mind. But it was going to be really good.
What's going on?
What is it?
So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
That's great!
So... I quit.
Why?
Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.
If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.
So was it a lot more money?
It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
... the WENUS?
Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
Oh. That WENUS.
So what're you going to do?
I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
Ooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.
Um... hi there.
Hi! Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so...
Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
Yeah, yeah!
Well, what kind of food is he looking for?
Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.
Oh my God!
Yeah, I know! So, what do you think?
Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
OK. Oh Monica! Guess what!
Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. I added the a-gogo.
Career counselor?
Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.
I don't!
Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
Ah, the lesser-known I don't have a dream speech.
Oh, I love my life, I love my life!
Ooh! Brian's Song!
The meeting with the guy went great?
So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
What are you going to make?
Yummy noises.
And Monica, what are you going to make?
I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!
Ooh! I know what you could make! I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know.
Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
Who are you going out with?
Oh, is this the bug lady?
Bzzzz... I love you, Ross.
Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.
So what are you guys going to do?
Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.
And he's not speaking metaphorically.
So... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... huh-huh?
Well, I don't know... huh-huh... but I'm hoping huh-huh.
I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.
Celia, don't worry! Don't scream! He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...
I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my...
Alright...
OK, try this salmon mousse.
mmm. Good.
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
It's creamier.
Yeah, well, is that better?
I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
My God! What happened to you?
Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation.
That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
Well... it is amouz-ing...
Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. Alright, I'll see you then. Bye.
Ten dollars an hour for what?
Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.
Waitressing?
Uh-oh.
Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...
But, but?
But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.
Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.
You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. Amouz-bouche?
Talk to me.
OK... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...
No no no. Talk... dirty.
Wha... what, here?
Yes...
Ah...
Say something... hot.
Er... um...
What?
Um... uh... vulva.
Vulva?
Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.
Whoaa! You cuddled? How many times?
Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
Please be kidding.
Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
OK. I'm in my apartment...
...yeah... what else?
That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation.
Alright, look, I'll start, OK?
Joey, please.
Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! Oh... Ross... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.
Wow.
Alright, now you say something.
I... ahem... I really don't think so.
Come on! You like this woman, right?
Yeah.
You want to see her again, right?
Sure.
Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!
OK, turn around. I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.
Ahem... I want... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
I, er...
I want to take my tongue... and...
...and...
Say it... say it!
...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
...with?
Funny story!
You're not going to believe this!
It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.
Again?
And again, and again, and again... Hello? And again.
Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? Yeah, I miss you too. Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? Well, that's very generous er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about... And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! I'll see you on Monday!
Well?
Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
Look at this!
Oh! You have a window!
Yes indeedy! With a beautiful view of...
Oh look! That guy's peeing!
OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.
OK.
This is great! Helen, could you come in here for a moment?
Thank you Helen, that'll be all.
Last time I do that, I promise.
Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!
Who was that?
Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.
Ten dollars an hour.
No.
Twelve dollars an hour.
Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.
You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour.
Done.
Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
Hi Steve!
Hello, Monica. Hello, greeter girl.
This is Rachel.
Yeah, OK.
mmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of of, OK, smells.
It's a lovely apartment.
Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?
I was just being polite, but, alright.
What's up?
In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie.
What?
Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?
OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK.
Is it dry in here?
Let me, let me get you some wine!
Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... with just a touch of mints... and... ginger.
Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic!
I'm so glad you liked them!
Like 'em? I could eat a hundred of them!
Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.
Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning.
Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?
You know, I don't know what I'm looking for.
Ah, cool! Taco shells! You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope.
You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.
Hey! Sugar-O's!
You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!
No, we don't.
Oh, OK. Oh, sorry.
Why don't you just have a seat here? OK... give me the Gummi-bears.
No.
Give them to me.
Alright, we'll share.
No, give me the...
Well then you can't have any. Bear overboard! I think he's drowning. Hey fellows! Grab on a Sugar-O... save yourself! Help! I'm drowning! Help!
That's it! Dinner is over!
What?
What?
Why?
Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?
Hey!
What a tool!
You don't want to work for a guy like that.
Yeah!
I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.
Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.
Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.
So, er... how did it go with Celia?
Oh, I was unbelievable.
Alright, Ross!
I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.
Whoa! And the... huh-huh?
Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...
You cuddled.
Yeah, which was nice.
You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?
Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
Yeah, where the hell is he?
Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! Whoooaaa...
How's this?
Eeee!
Sorry. How about over here?
aaah!
See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt?
No.
What about this?
aaahhh!
There you go!
This is unbelievable. It's been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, you'd be looking like a ham right about now.
There's the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?
It's Phoebe! Hi!
Hi. Okay, will that be all?
Wait, wait! what are you doing here?
Yeah, um, I was over there, then you said, Excuse me, hello Miss, so now I'm here.
No, no... how come you are working here?
Right, yeah, 'cause its close to where I live, and the aprons are really cute.
Can we start over?
Yeah. Okay great. I'm gonna be over here.
No, no, no!
I don't know whether he's testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, supposedly by accident.
No, yeah, I've done that.
And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword.
I've never done that.
Alright, now look at her and tell me she doesn't look exactly like her sister.
I'm sayin' I see a difference.
They're twins!
I don't care. Phoebe's Phoebe. Ursula's... hot!
You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?
Yeah.
Let's not do that any more.
Hey guys! Hey!
Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today.
Ooh, ooh, fun! Okay... um, Liam Neeson.
Nope.
Morly Safer.
Nope.
The woman who cuts my hair!
Okay, look, this could be a really long game.
Your sister Ursula.
Oh, really.
Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh...
Rift's. Yeah, I know.
Oh, you do? Because she said you guys haven't talked in like years.
Hmmm? Yeah. So, um, is she fat?
Not from where I was standin'.
where were you standing?
Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just don't get along?
It's mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it... later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like yeah, right, well what else is new?
Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, I've got to go. I've got Lamaze class.
Oh, and I've got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.
So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?
No, Susan's gonna be there too. We've got dads, we've got lesbians, the whole parenting team.
Well, isn't, isn't that gonna be weird?
No, no. I mean, it mighta been at first, but by now I, I think I'm pretty comfortable with the whole situation.
Ross, that's my jacket.
I know.
Hi, we're the Rostins. Err, I'm J.C., and he's Michael, and we're having a boy, and a girl.
Good for you. Alrighty, next?
Hi, um, I'm err, I'm Ross Geller, and err ah...that's, that's my boy in there, and uh, this is Carol Willick, and this... is Susan Bunch. Susan is um Carol's, just, com...who's next?
I'm sorry, I didn't get... Susan is?
Susan is Carol's, Carol's, Carol's, friend...
Life partner.
Like buddies.
Like lovers.
You know how close women can get.
Susan and I live together.
Although I was married to her.
Carol, not me.
Err, right.
It's a little complicated.
A little.
But we're fine.
Absolutely. So, twins... hah! That's like two births. Ouch.
And to you too, Helen.
Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.
Oh, okay. Send her in.
Hi.
Hi, Nina. Come on in.
You wanted to see me?
Uh, Yes. Yes. I've just been going over your data here, and little thing, you've been post-dating your Friday numbers.
Which is bad, because?
Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.
Your... excuse me?
WENUS. Weekly Estimated Net...
Oh, Net Usage Statistics, right. Gotcha, gotcha. Won't happen again. I wouldn't want to do anything to hurt your... wenus.
It's not just that she's cute, okay. It's just that... she's really really cute.
It doesn't matter. You don't dip your pen in the company ink.
Ross, your little creature's got the remote again.
Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote...
Great.
Relax, I'll fix it.
Cool... Urkel in Spanish is Urkel.
How did he do this?
So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Year's... but obviously someone forgot.
Well, someone was supposed to write Rach, take down the lights and put it on the re... frigerate... How long has that been there?
Hey, where you been?
I went back to Riff's. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries.
Score.
She is so hot!
Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err...
Pheebs?
Yeah?
You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?
Why? Why would you wanna... do that? Why?
So that if we went out on a date, she'd be there.
Well, I mean, I'm not my sister's, you know, whatever, and um... I mean, it's true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, we've grown apart, so, um... I don't know, why not? Okay.
Cool, thanks.
You okay?
Yeah I'm fine.
You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?
Sorry.
Hi. Sorry I'm late. Where's, where's Carol?
Stuck at school. Some parent-teacher thing. You can go. I'll get the information.
No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know what's going on.
Oh, good. This'll be fun.
Alrighty. We're gonna start with some basic third stage breathing exercises, so Mummies, why don't you get on your back? And... coaches, you should be supporting Mummy's head.
What? What? What?
I am supposed to be the mommy?
Okay, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time.
Look, I don't see why I should have to miss out on the coaching training just because I'm a woman.
I see. So what do you propose to do?
I will flip you for it.
Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!
On your back... Mom.
Alright, Mommies, take a nice deep cleansing breath.
Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.
Mr. D, how's it going, sir?
Ohh, it's been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in.
And?
It's pretty ugly. We haven't seen an ANUS this bad since the seventies.
So what does this mean?
Well, we're gonna be layin' off people in every department.
Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very...
Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone?
Nina? Nina. Nina. Nina.
Are you okay?
Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please don't hate me.
What?
Would you like to have dinner sometime?
So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?
Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.
Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?
Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.
Ooh, okay... good.
What is this place?
Look, you're cold, I have to pee, and...there's a cup of coffee on the window. How bad could it be?
I think we have an answer.
What's she doing here?
This could be God's way of telling us to eat at home.
Think she got fired at Riff's?
No, no, no. We were there last night. She kept...bringing swordfish. are you gonna go to the, um?
I'm gonna wait till after we order. It's her, right.
It looks like her.
Um, excuse me.
Yeah?
Hi, it's us.
Right, and it's me.
So, so you're here too?
Much as you are.
Your turn.
Err... we know what we want.
Oh, that's good.
All we want is two Caffe Lattes.
And some biscottie cookies.
Good choice.
Definitely her.
Yeah.
I can't believe you. You still haven't told that girl she doesn't have a job yet?
Well, you still haven't taken down the Christmas lights.
Congratulations, I think you've found the world's thinnest argument.
I'm just trying to find the right moment, you know?
Oh, well, that shouldn't be so hard, now that you're dating. Sweetheart, you're fired, but how 'bout a quickie before I go to work?
Hey.
Hey.
You know, once you're inside, you don't have to knock any more.
I'll get it.
Oh. Hi, Mr.Heckles.
You're doing it again.
We're not doing anything. We're just sitting around talking, quietly.
I can hear you through the ceiling. My cats can't sleep.
You don't even have cats.
I could have cats.
Goodbye Mr.Heckles.
We'll try to keep it down.
Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits.
Ooh, my first birthday present...oh, this is really...
Oh, no no no. It's for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size-wise.
Ohhh... Sure, yeah...okay, it fits.
Are you seein' her again tonight?
Yep. Ice Capades.
Wow, this is serious. I've never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.
I don't know. I like her, you know. She's different. There's uh, somethin' about her.
That you like, we get it. You like her. Great!
Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay.
Alright, well, maybe now it's not okay.
Okay... Well maybe now I'm not okay with it not being okay.
Okay.
Knit, good woman, knit, knit!
And that's the Chrysler Building right there.
Nina.
Mr.Douglas...cool tie.
She's still here.
Yes, yes she is. Didn't I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.
And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.
You're kidding? She seems so...
Oh, no, no. Nina...she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.
That's unbelievable.
And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.
I see. I guess you never really know what's goin' on inside a person's head.
Well, I guess that's why they call it psychology, sir.
..a sound Mom and Dad never forget. For this after all, is the miracle of birth.
Lights please? And that's having a baby. Next week is our final class.
Susan, go deep.
This is impossible. It's just impossible.
What is, honey?
What that woman... did. I am not doin' that. It's just gonna have to stay in, that's all, everything will be the same, it'll just stay in.
Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everything's gonna be alright.
Oh, what do you know? No one's going up to you and saying, Hi, is that your nostril? Mind if we push this pot roast through it?
Carol, Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath.
I know it's frightening, but, big picture. The birth part is just one day, and when it's over, we're all gonna be parents for the rest of our lives.
I mean, that's what this is all about, right? Ross? Ross?
I'm gonna be a father.
This is just occurring to you?
I always knew I was havin' a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me.
Oh, you're gonna be great!
Aw, how can you say that? I can't even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?
You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.
Where're you going?
Out.
With?
Yes.
Alright, could I just ask you one question?
Have you two, you know... like... you know... you know... yet?
Well, not that it's any of your business, but, no, we haven't, okay?
You meant sex, right?
Do you have a sec?
Ah, sure, Nina. What's up?
I don't know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks.
Oh, well, ah... maybe that's because they're ah... jealous, of us.
Maybe. But that doesn't explain why they keep taking my scissors.
Ah, well, maybe that's, ah, because you're getting a big raise.
I am?
Sure, why not?
Oh my god! You're amazing!
Oh, you don't know. Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder's raise?
So you still want me to send her psychological profile to Personnel?
What?
Helen drinks. Will you marry me?
Well, I ended up telling her everything.
Oh, how'd she take it?
Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: if you're ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand...on the desk.
Okay, I think I get how to do this.
Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go away? Because I can't, I can't watch.
okay, Pheebs, they're gone.
Okay.
Are you alright?
Yeah. It's just, you know, it's this whole stupid Ursula thing, it's...
Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, he's going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?
Um, yeah. Look, I mean, I'm not saying she's like evil or anything. She just, you know, she's always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldn't let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?
No.
Well, but that's what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldn't even talk to me any more. Because he said he didn't wanna be around... anything that looked like either one of us.
Oh... Oh, Pheebs.
I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...
You're not gonna lose him.
Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.
Yeah. Okay.
No, come on, he doesn't know this stuff. If he knew how you felt.
But he's falling in love with her.
Oh please, they've been going out a week. They haven't even slept together yet, I mean, that's not serious.
Okay... Okay.
Oh, okay, oh.
Oh.
Yeah, um, may we help you?

Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something.
My god. You still have your Christmas lights up?
Fill this out and bring it back to me.
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.
Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... Okay, in case of emergency, call?
You.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh, that is so sweet. Oh gosh, love you. Insurance?
Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that.
you don't have insurance?
Why, how much is this gonna cost?
I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.
Wel-wel-well what are we gonna do?
Well there's not much we can do.
Um... unless, unless I use yours.
Hah, no no no no.
well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as my In case of emergency person?
That's insurance fraud.
Well, alright, then, forget it. Might as well just go home. Ow ow ow ow!
Okay, okay. I hate this.
Thank you. Thank you. I love you.
Hi, um, I'm gonna need a new set of these forms .
Why?
I am really an idiot. you see, I was filling out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, I put mine.
You are an idiot..
yep, that's me, I am that stupid .
I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.
That's nice.
No, no, with him. I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.
Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.
What are you crazy? That's a baby!
He should take the sack?
Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.
Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.
Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?
Well, only if you order stuff.
I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
When's that?
Tonight.
Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?
You take your time.
There it is! So what're you gonna do?
What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.
And your friend Phoebe?
Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?
Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
..you add a pinch of saffron, it makes all the difference.
Okay, errrr, Monica?
Yes? ..yes, she is.
Hi, this is my friend Rachel.
Hi.
Hi, err Rachel. I'm Dr.Mitchell.
And I'm his friend, Dr.Rosen.
Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
Excuse me?
I meant er, young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor. Oh good, Rach.
Thank you.
Right.
..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.
Uh, you left out the stupid part.
Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said yes.
I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.
What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, cute doctors, doctors who are cute!
Alright, what have we learned so far?
SURPRISE!
What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.
Was that the cake?
Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush.
Come on, she'll be here any minute.
I hope it's okay.
Oh...
Happy Birthday Peehe.
Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses.
Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools.
Hey, what's going on?
Oh, we just...
Surprise!
oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, Hi! You found Betty! Oh my god! This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room, Where's Joey?
Did you see Betty?
I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say get out of my office!
Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?
I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea and...;
Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, Oh my god I'm gonna be a father kind of a thing?
No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?
No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.
'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that?
Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?
Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew.
So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?
No, we can go to Williamsburg.
Eat your fish.
Rachel, the cute doctors are here.
Okay, coming!
Hi, come on in.
Hey.
Hi, Geoffrey.
Hi.
Ah here, we brought wine.
Look at this, it's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine, so how could we resist?
Oh, that's great. Look at that.
So, Monica, how's the ankle?
It's uh...
..well, why don't you tell them? After all it, is your ankle.
You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you, um... Well, listen, why don't you two sit down and, and we'll get you some glasses... okay... STAT!
Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine.
It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?
A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?
So?
So... they sss-still seem normal.
That's because they are.
okay, but you have to admit that every time we go out... Women we meet at the hospital... It turns into...
Willya relax? Look around. No pagan altars, no piles of bones in the corners, they're fine. Go like this.
I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.
I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...
Sure, every time, you're such a princess...
You know what?
What?
You know what?
What!?
You know what?
What!?
Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.
Hello! Here we go!
This is a great place. How long have you lived here?
Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago.
Yeah...see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar.
Really?
Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me. Why don't you try the hummus?
So, Monica, what do you do?
Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
Good for you.
Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.
This hummus is great.
God bless the chickpea.
Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!
And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?
I used to wet my bed.
I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
We both do that!
Monica and Rachel's apartment. Err yeh, aayah, yeh, just one second...ah, Rachel, it's your dad.
Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...
Would you excuse me for a second?
Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business! ...dead!
Ross, he's got the remote again.
Good. Maybe he can switch it back.
Maybe not.
Hello? Um, yeah, uh, Okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just check and see if see if she's here.
It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god...
Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!
Okay no, you do it.
Hello, this is Monica... Yeah? Oh... Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down. Thank you.
What?
We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
Ohhh... Okay, you were right. You were right! This was just not worth it.
Thank you.
Okay, let me just change.
Yes.
Hey.
Hey!
Hi.
Trouble?
Your sister stood me up the other night.
Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?
Well did you try calling her?
I've been trying for two days. When I called the restaurant, they said she was too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off.
Hey.
Oh!
Um you, you got a minute?
Um, yeah, I'm just...working.
So.
Uh-huh.
Um, oh, I got you a birthday present.
Oh, wow! You remembered! Oh! It's a Judy Jetson thermos!
Right, like the kind you...
Right... Oh, I got something for you, too.
How'd you know I was coming?
Um, yeah, um, twin thing.
I can't believe you did this.
I can't believe you...did this.
So... What's the deal with umm, you and Joey?
Oh, right. He is so great. But that's over.
Does he know?
Who?
Joey. You know, um, he's really nutsy about you.
He is? Why?
You got me.
Right.
Excuse me. Doesn't this come with a side salad?
So, um, are you gonna call him?
What? Do you think he likes me?
No, Joey.
Oh. No, no, he is so smart. He'll figure it out. Do you want some chicken?
No. No food with a face.
You have not changed!
Yeah, you too.
Hi, remember us?
Mmm hmmm.
Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one because uh, you see, I, I put the wrong name again. 'cause um...
You're that stupid.
I am. I'm that stupid.
Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
Well, you know your insurance will cover that.
Yeah, I know...I'm I'm just not that bright either.
Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.
Uh-huh.
Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.
Do you have a point?
You know, you think I would.
What's up with the simian?
It's just a fur ball.
Okay...whose turn is it?
Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'.
No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'.
I had a 'K'. Where's where's my 'K'?
You've got to help me my monkey swallowed a 'K'!
You go get that animal outta here.
No, no you don't understand the animal hospital is way across town he's choking I don't know what else to do.
What's goin' on?
Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
Oh.
Excuse me... This hospital is for people!
Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches Jeopardy! He he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please have a heart!
I'll take a look at him.
Oh, thank you.
Michael.
Rachel.
What?
Monica.
Oh.
Hi.
Hi.
Hey.
Urse...
..ah, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you.
Listen, um...
No, no, no, don't say listen. I know that listen. I've said that listen.
I'm sorry.
I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge?
: Yeah, um... You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' crazy that night, I was so drunk!
You don't drink.
That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!
Oh, Urse...
Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.
Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
no. No, I, I couldn't do that.
Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me.
Then, uh, then I'm sorry.
You know... You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.
I know...
I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or... what, but you have never looked so beautiful.
Really?
Pheebs?
Yeah. Ooh...
He looks so tiny.
We just got the message.
Is he alright?
Yeah. The doctor got the 'K' out. He also found an 'M' and an 'O'.
We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now.
So, you feel like a dad yet?
No, why?
Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad.
Oh, look, he's waking up!
hey, fella! How you doing?
Aqui esta.
A quien pidio el pollo General Tso?
Pudo aver sido General Tso!
Mira, mira, el viejo desnudo esta haciendo el hula hoop!
Ewww!
Hola, Joey!
Hola, amigos!
Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el control remoto.
Lo que sucedio es que no le gusta la tele!
Uh, Rach, we're running low on resumes over here.
Do you really want a job with Popular Mechanics?
Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for.
Hey, look, you guys, I'm going for anything here, OK? I cannot be a waitress anymore, I mean it. I'm sick of the lousy tips, I'm sick of being called 'Excuse me...'
Rach, did you proofread these?
Uh... yeah, why?
Uh, nothing, I'm sure they'll be impressed with your excellent compuper skills.
Oh my God! Oh, do you think it's on all of them?
Oh no, I'm sure the Xerox machine caught a few.
Hey, guys.
Hey.
Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? : Did you bring the mail?
Lots of responses.
: Really? : Sure, we have scones left! : OK, read them to me.
: Dear Ms. Green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh...
: We have apple cinnamon...
: OK... Dear Ms. Green... yeah... yeah... yeah... No.
Wow!
What?
: Your Visa bill is huge!
Give me that!
You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?
I don't know.
Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
No, it's not just that. It's just I want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh...
...little playthings with yarn?
What?
Could you want her more?
Who?
Dee, the sarcastic sister from what's Happening.
Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just... : Hiii!
Hi! How are you?
We're fine, we're fine.
OK.
Shut up!
We're not we're not saying anything.
What?
Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.
Thank you.
We were playing poker, alright...
There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?
Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'
And then he did.
Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?
Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?
No, women are welcome to play.
Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?
There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.
Oh, yeah, right.
Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!
Really.
I mean, that's a typical guy response.
Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?
No.
But you could teach us.
No.
OK, so now we draw cards.
So I wouldn't need any, right? 'cause I have a straight.
Oh, good for you!
Congratulations!
OK Phoebs, how many do you want?
OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs.
No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can't you can't do...
Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here!
No, no. Uh... no, see, uh, you can't do that.
Oh, no no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for fours.
Oh, you're...
Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.
OOooo!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...
OK, so at this point, the dealer...
Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...
Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy...
But... I'm ready, so, just deal.
OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. Alright babe, deal the cards.
Dammit, dammit, dammit!
: Oh I see, so then, you were lying.
About what?
About how good your cards were.
Heh... I was bluffing.
A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow...
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.
Settle what?
The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...
The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.
Oh. Right.
You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?
Hell no, we'll pay!
OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready.
And you know what? We want a rematch.
Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
: So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends.
...Yeah.
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.
Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? 'cause once those cards are dealt...
...Yeah?
I'm not a nice guy.
Alright boys, let's eat.
Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?
You still on that?
Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!
You are way off, pal.
No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.
Um... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one time not any more. I just I...
Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OK if you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble.
Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
Ha. Ha, ha.
What?
Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.
Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?
That was not an incident! I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.
Ooh. : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
You're kidding! Where? Where?
: Sak's... Fifth... Avenue.
Oh, Rachel!
Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home.
Well, what's the job?
Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!
OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. Hi!
Is Tony Randall dead?
No.
I don't think so.
Why?
Well, he may be now, because I think I hit him with my car.
What?
Oh my God!
Really?
No! That's bluffing. Lesson number one. Let me tell you something... everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap. : Nice earrings.
Thank y...
Girls, sit down.
Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen, I am parked at a meter. Let's do it.
Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?
Alright.
I'm gonna pay for that tonight.
Hi!
Hey.
Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!
Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?
Nooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, and oh, I went to camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!
That's great! That's wonderful!
Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...
OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.
Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.
Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?
Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?
Yes, we should. I think we should.
Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?
No, no, That's OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go.
Alright.
Alright...
So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.
Alright, here's my $7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
What?
Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women.
You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.
Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon.
So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.
Ooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.
OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?
Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. Right, OK, serious poker.
Excuse me, where are you going?
Uh... to the bathroom.
Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?
I want to go to the bathroom.
Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza.
Oh no no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store closes at nine, so you can eat then.
That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.
Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante.
Yes! ... or no.
Alright. : Your money's mine, Green.
Your fly is open, Geller.
You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!
Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?
Yeah. Um... I'm out.
I'm in.
Me too.
Me too. Alright, whattaya got.
Well, you better hop outta the shower, 'cause... I gotta flush.
Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, 'cause I got four sixes! I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile. I think that one was Ross's, and I think oh that one was Ross's. Yes! : Well, I have got your money, and you'll never see it...
And your fly's still open...
Ha, I made you look...
I couldn't be inner. Monica?
Monica, in or out?
I hate this game!
OK Joey, your bet.
Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face. Oh, I'm out.
Ross?
Oh, I am very in.
Chandler?
Couldn't be more out.
Me too. Rachel.
Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. What do you say... want to waste another buck?
No, not this time. So... what'd you have?
I'm not telling.
Come on, show them to me.
No..!
Show them to me!
Get your hands out of there! No!
Let me see! Show them!
Y'know, I've had dates like this.
Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Your whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple...
